# Install dependencies

# Install spaCy model

```

## Code Style Guidelines

We keep it simple but consistent:

1. Use clear, descriptive variable names:
```python
# Good
chapter_content = generate_chapter(topic)
word_count = len(text.split())

# Bad
cont = gen(t)
wc = len(t.split())
```

2. Add comments for complex logic:
```python
# Good
# Calculate average emotion intensity across all chapters
avg_emotion = sum(emotions.values()) / len(emotions)

# Bad
avg_emotion = sum(emotions.values()) / len(emotions)  # Calculate average
```

3. Use docstrings for functions:
```python
def improve_text(text: str) -> str:
    """
    Improves the quality of generated text.

    Args:
        text: Input text to improve

    Returns:
        Improved version of the text
    """
```

4. Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
