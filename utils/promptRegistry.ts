    userPrompt: `Based on the following story premise, create a detailed story outline for a {{chapters_count}}-chapter book. The outline should be comprehensive, covering main plot points, character arcs, subplots, and key events for each part of the story (beginning, middle, and end).

STORY PREMISE: "{{story_premise}}"

**üö´ CRITICAL: FORBIDDEN WORDS - DO NOT USE AS CHARACTER NAMES OR IN ANY CONTEXT:**
NEVER use these words anywhere in the outline (including character names, place names, or descriptions):
- "obsidian" or any derivatives (obsidian-like, Obsidian as name)
- "thorn", "thorne", or any derivatives (thorns, thorny, Thorne as name, Thornfield, etc.)
- "crystalline", "gossamer", "eldritch", "ephemeral", "ethereal", "luminescent"

Use alternative words: "black stone", "spike", "sharp point", "clear", "thin", "strange", "brief", "faint", "glowing"
This applies to ALL parts of the outline including character names and locations.

Please structure your response with the following sections clearly marked:
1.  **LOGLINE:** A single sentence summarizing the core conflict.
2.  **MAIN CHARACTERS:** A list of the main characters with a brief (2-3 sentence) description of their personality, motivation, and core conflict/arc.
3.  **STORY ARC (THREE ACT STRUCTURE):**
    *   **ACT I (The Setup):** Introduction to the world and characters, the inciting incident, and the protagonist's initial goal. (Covers roughly the first 25% of chapters).
    *   **ACT II (The Confrontation):** Rising action, new challenges, character development, introduction of allies and enemies, the midpoint (a major turning point), and escalating stakes. (Covers roughly the next 50% of chapters).
    *   **ACT III (The Resolution):** The climax, falling action, and the final resolution of the main plot and character arcs. (Covers roughly the final 25% of chapters).
4.  **WORLD BUILDING DETAILS:** Key details about the setting, magic system (if any), culture, etc.
5.  **RECURRING MOTIFS/THEMES:** List 3-5 recurring symbols, ideas, or themes that will be woven throughout the narrative.`

    userPrompt: `Create a detailed plan for {{num_chapters}} chapters based on this story outline. Each chapter needs specific conflict, character growth, and forward momentum.

**üéØ TOP 5 PLANNING PRIORITIES:**

1. **CONFLICT IN EVERY CHAPTER** - Specify 'conflictType':
   - External: fights, obstacles, chases
   - Internal: moral dilemmas, self-doubt, difficult choices
   - Interpersonal: relationship tension, betrayal, competition
   - Societal: system vs individual, corruption, injustice

2. **MORAL COMPLEXITY** - Specify 'moralDilemma':
   - No easy answers, characters face impossible choices
   - Good people make questionable decisions
   - Antagonists have understandable motivations
   - Show consequences of every choice

3. **CHARACTER DEPTH** - Specify 'characterComplexity':
   - Reveal contradictions and flaws
   - Internal conflicts that drive external action
   - Character change through difficult decisions
   - Avoid archetypes, create complex people

4. **PACING RHYTHM** - Specify 'rhythmPacing' (fast/medium/slow):
   - Fast: action-heavy, dialogue-driven scenes
   - Medium: balanced action and introspection
   - Slow: character development, world-building
   - Alternate deliberately across chapters

5. **ESCALATING TENSION** - Rate 'tensionLevel' (1-10):
   - Build systematically toward climax
   - Create peaks and strategic valleys
   - Personal stakes before global ones
   - Each chapter raises what's at risk

**üìã CHAPTER STRUCTURE TEMPLATE:**
- **Opening:** Hook that connects to previous chapter
- **Development:** ONE major event + ONE character change
- **Complication:** New problem or revelation
- **Escalation:** Raise stakes or reveal consequence
- **Hook ending:** Question or threat for next chapter

**‚ö° SPECIAL CHAPTER TYPES:**

**Chapters 1-3 (Hook Phase):**
- Prioritize plot momentum over world-building
- Establish conflict quickly
- Show character in action, not description

**Middle Chapters (Anti-Sag Rules):**
- Vary patterns: no two consecutive chapters with same structure
- Introduce new complications vs repeating old ones
- Shift locations, add characters, reveal information
- Avoid "another chase/fight/betrayal" - make each unique

**Final Chapters (Resolution Phase):**
- Resolve all established conflicts clearly
- Hero must be changed by journey (physical/psychological scars)
- Cost of victory - something permanent changes
- Internal growth as important as external victory

**üìñ EXAMPLE CHAPTER STRUCTURE:**
Chapter 3: "The Betrayal"
- conflictType: "interpersonal"
- moralDilemma: "Protagonist must choose between saving friend or mission"
- characterComplexity: "Hero realizes they enjoy the power they're fighting against"
- tensionLevel: 7
- rhythmPacing: "fast"
- consequencesOfChoices: "Friend's trust is broken, mission compromised"

{{chapter_content_preview}}

**ü§ñ AI PATTERN DETECTION (PRIORITY 1):**
1. **STRUCTURAL TEMPLATING:** Does this chapter start/develop exactly like others? Flag mechanical repetition.
2. **EMOTIONAL EXCESS:** Are all feelings at maximum intensity? ("overwhelming terror" vs natural "uneasy")
3. **OVER-EXPLANATION:** Does text explain what's already shown? ("he was angry because...")
4. **PERFECT PROSE:** Is rhythm too smooth? Flag if no awkward/broken sentences.
5. **ARTIFICIAL BEAUTY:** Descriptions for prettiness vs function? ("ethereal moonlight" vs useful details)

**üë§ HUMANITY MISSING:**
6. **PERSONAL STRANGENESS:** Does character notice anything weird/unrelated to plot?
7. **PHYSICAL REALITY:** Any mundane needs? (hunger, discomfort, random thoughts)
8. **IMPERFECTION:** Any stumbles, mishearing, irrational moments?
9. **UNRESOLVED ELEMENTS:** Anything mentioned but not explained?
10. **CONVERSATION REALITY:** Do people interrupt, say "um", misunderstand?

**üí≠ SUBJECTIVITY CHECK:**
- Does character think only about plot? (Add random tangents)
- Are all metaphors predictable? (Need personal, weird associations)
- Too many literary constructions? (Need simpler, concrete language)

**üéØ RESPONSE FORMAT:**
List specific AI patterns found:
- "MECHANICAL STRUCTURE: Starts exactly like Chapter X..."
- "EMOTIONAL EXCESS: 'crushing despair' - use smaller emotion"
- "MISSING HUMANITY: No personal details or random thoughts"
- "OVER-BEAUTIFUL: 'ancient mystical energy' - be concrete instead"

If chapter feels human-written, say "FEELS HUMAN" and note what works.

{{critique_notes}}

**HYBRID SYSTEM CONTEXT:**
This chapter was generated by specialist agents:
- Structure Agent: Created framework and transitions
- Character Agent: Generated dialogue and internal thoughts
- Scene Agent: Provided descriptions and action
- Synthesis Agent: Combined all content

**‚ö° INTEGRATION-FIX TARGETS (MINIMAL CHANGES ONLY):**

1. **TRANSITION SEAMS:**
   - Where dialogue meets description awkwardly
   - Where action sequences feel disconnected
   - Where internal thoughts don't flow into external action

2. **TONE INCONSISTENCIES:**
   - Minor mismatches between character voice and description tone
   - Slight pacing hiccups between fast action and slow moments

3. **REPETITION FIXES:**
   - Same information mentioned too close together by different agents
   - Similar sentence structures stacked from different sources

4. **FLOW IMPROVEMENTS:**
   - Add 1-2 words for better sentence connection
   - Adjust paragraph breaks for better rhythm
   - Fix pronoun clarity where multiple agents referenced same character

**üö´ STRICT LIMITATIONS:**
- Change MAXIMUM 3% of text
- DO NOT rewrite specialist content - only smooth connections
- Preserve all plot points, dialogue substance, character voices
- DO NOT add new descriptions or dialogue - only adjust flow

**‚úÖ APPROVED MICRO-EDITS:**
- Add/remove connecting words ("but", "then", "still")
- Adjust sentence breaks for better flow
- Fix pronoun references for clarity
- Merge or split paragraphs for better pacing
- Replace repeated words with synonyms in adjacent sentences

**CHAPTER CONTENT:**
{{chapter_content}}

**üîß CRITICAL: UNFILLED SLOT CLEANUP:**
If you see any unfilled markers like [SLOT_NAME], [DESCRIPTION_X], [DIALOGUE_X], [ACTION_X], [INTERNAL_X] in the text:
- These are ERRORS from the generation process
- You MUST either:
  a) Remove them completely if the text flows fine without them
  b) Replace them with appropriate brief content that fits the context
- DO NOT leave any [BRACKET_MARKERS] in the final text
- This is MANDATORY - scan the entire chapter for any remaining markers

- Demonstrate consequences clearly
- Show don't tell, simple language, strong verbs

**ü§ñ ANTI-AI WRITING REQUIREMENTS:**
- No identical chapter openings (avoid structural templates)
- Mix emotions - not everything at maximum intensity
- Add mundane reality: hunger, fatigue, random thoughts
- Include imperfect dialogue: interruptions, mishearing, "um"
- Character notices something weird/unrelated to plot
- Avoid beautiful-for-beautiful's-sake descriptions
- Include awkward sentence breaks or trailing thoughts
- Characters sometimes say exactly what they don't mean
- Add physical discomforts or minor annoyances

**üö´ FORBIDDEN WORDS:** "obsidian" ‚Üí "black stone", "thorn/thorne" ‚Üí "spike", avoid "ethereal/crystalline/gossamer"

**üîß CRITICAL: UNFILLED SLOT CLEANUP:**

- Add concrete details where too abstract
- Improve dialogue naturalness (subtext, interruptions)
- Remove filter words ("she felt that...")
- Break up parallel patterns ("She X. She Y. She Z.")

**ü§ñ HUMANIZATION PRIORITIES:**
- Replace "perfect" emotional descriptions with messier reality
- Add small physical details (scratchy fabric, cold hands, growling stomach)
- Include one random thought unrelated to main plot
- Make one conversation slightly imperfect (mishearing, interruption)
- Add mundane environmental details (weather affecting mood)
- Include character noticing something weird but unimportant
- Break one sentence awkwardly or let thought trail off
- Replace one beautiful description with functional detail

Perfect prose is AI prose. Humans write with small imperfections:
- Occasional awkward sentence breaks
- Trailing thoughts that go nowhere
- Mundane details (weather, discomfort)
- Characters not always saying what they mean
- Real emotions mixed with contradictory feelings

**FRAMEWORK REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **OPENING HOOK** - Start with immediate engagement
2. **SCENE TRANSITIONS** - Clear structural shifts between scenes
3. **PACING CONTROL** - Balance action/reflection/dialogue sections
4. **CHAPTER ARC** - Clear beginning ‚Üí development ‚Üí climax/cliffhanger
5. **SLOT MARKERS** - Use these exact markers for other agents:

   - [INTERNAL_X] - For internal monologue
   - [DESCRIPTION_X] - For environmental details
   - [ACTION_X] - For physical action
   - [TRANSITION_X] - For scene/time changes

**STRUCTURE OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Create a chapter framework with clear sections and slot markers. Example:

"The morning came with frost covering the windows. [DESCRIPTION_OPENING]

Marcus approached the door, his hand hesitating on the handle. [INTERNAL_HESITATION]

'Are you certain about this?' Elena asked. [DIALOGUE_QUESTION]

[ACTION_INTRUSION] The door burst open and soldiers poured in.

[TRANSITION_ESCAPE] Hours later, in the underground chamber..."

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- NO actual dialogue/descriptions - only frameworks and slot markers
- Focus on STRUCTURE and PACING, not content
- Address specific issues: {{target_issues}}
- Ensure {{conflict_type}} conflict drives the structure

- **Overloaded monologues**: Balance [INTERNAL_X] vs [ACTION_X] slots
- **Abstract endings**: Framework for concrete, specific conclusions
- **Information dumps**: NO major revelations without prior hints
- **Constant intensity**: Require breathing room after high-tension sections

**üìö INFORMATION REVEAL RULES:**
- **Major revelation**: Must have 2-3 hints in previous chapters
- **Character backstory**: Reveal in layers, not info dumps
- **World secrets**: Foreshadow before revealing
- **NO** sudden appearance of new important elements
- **Emotional weight**: Reader must care BEFORE the reveal

**‚è∞ PACING INTELLIGENCE:**
- **After intense action**: Force breathing room (quiet reflection/setup)
- **Before climax**: Build tension gradually, don't start at maximum

   - Active voice constructions ("she grabbed" not "was grabbed")
   - Specific movement and positioning
   - Immediate, visceral details
   - **WORLD CONSISTENCY**: Actions must follow established physical/magical laws

3. **[TRANSITION_X] slots:**
   - Smooth scene/time transitions
   - Maintain narrative flow
   - Bridge between different locations/moments
   - **WORLD CONSISTENCY**: Travel/movement follows world's transportation rules

**SPECIFIC QUALITY TARGETS:**
- **Concrete Finals**: Specific, clear action conclusions
- **Active Voice**: Strong verbs, clear subjects performing actions
- **Balanced Description**: Essential details, not overwhelming sensory overload
- **Pacing Service**: Descriptions that enhance, not slow, narrative flow
- **World Clarity**: NO mixed technology/magic without clear rules (fix "—Ä–∞–∑–º—ã—Ç–∞—è –∫–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ –º–∏—Ä–∞")

**CRITICAL WORLD CONSISTENCY CHECKS:**
‚úÖ **Technology Consistency**: If using tech (holographs, plasma rifles), stick to sci-fi
‚úÖ **Magic Consistency**: If using magic (spells, barriers), stick to fantasy
‚úÖ **Hybrid Rules**: If world mixes both, must follow established fusion rules
‚úÖ **NO Contradiction**: Don't introduce elements that contradict established world
‚úÖ **Genre Clarity**: Each scene should reinforce the world's core identity

**SCENE CONSTRAINTS:**
{{scene_constraints}}

**FILL INSTRUCTIONS:**
- Replace ONLY [DESCRIPTION_X], [ACTION_X], and [TRANSITION_X] markers
- Keep all dialogue and character content intact
- Ensure descriptions support chapter pacing: {{rhythm_pacing}}
- Address descriptive issues: {{target_description_issues}}

Return the framework with SCENE slots filled, preserving all character content.`

  // Synthesis Agent - Integrates all specialist outputs
  registerPromptTemplate(PromptNames.SYNTHESIS_AGENT, {
    systemPrompt: `You are a Synthesis Agent responsible for seamlessly integrating content from Structure, Character, and Scene agents. Make MINIMAL changes - your job is integration, not rewriting.`,
    userPrompt: `Integrate the combined specialist outputs into a seamless chapter for Chapter {{chapter_number}}: "{{chapter_title}}"

**SPECIALIST OUTPUTS TO INTEGRATE:**
{{combined_content}}

**INTEGRATION TASKS:**

1. **Smooth Transitions**: Blend content where specialist outputs meet
2. **Flow Optimization**: Adjust paragraph breaks for better reading flow
3. **Pronoun Clarity**: Fix any unclear character references
4. **Consistency Check**: Ensure no contradictions between specialist content
5. **Final Polish**: Minor word choice improvements only
6. **üîß STRUCTURAL ISSUES**: Fix completion problems and pacing
7. **üéØ NARRATIVE FOCUS**: Ensure clear conclusions and motivations
8. **üìö PLOT CLOSURE**: Address any unresolved elements within chapter

**STRICT LIMITATIONS:**
- Change MAXIMUM 5% of specialist content
- DO NOT rewrite dialogue, descriptions, or character thoughts
- DO NOT add new content - only smooth connections
- Preserve ALL specialist expertise and quality

**SYNTHESIS RULES:**
- Fix transition awkwardness between agent outputs
- Resolve any minor contradictions
- Ensure paragraph flow and structure
- Maintain active voice from Scene Agent
- Preserve character authenticity from Character Agent
- Keep structural pacing from Structure Agent

**FINAL QUALITY TARGETS:**
Address integration issues while preserving specialist quality:
- Character name consistency (Character Agent handled this)
- Balanced pacing (Structure Agent handled this)
- Concrete conclusions (Scene Agent handled this)
- Active constructions (Scene Agent handled this)
- Psychological depth (Character Agent handled this)

**üö® CRITICAL FIXES FOR COMMON PROBLEMS:**

1. **–ù–µ–∑–∞–≤–µ—Ä—à—ë–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –¥–∏–∞–ª–æ–≥–∏**: Ensure ALL dialogue is complete, no placeholders left
2. **–ò–∑–±—ã—Ç–æ—á–Ω—ã–µ –æ–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏—è**: Trim stacked sensory details (max 2 per paragraph)
3. **–ü–æ–≤—Ç–æ—Ä—è—é—â–∏–µ—Å—è –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑—ã**: Remove duplicate metaphors/phrases
4. **–†–∞–∑–º—ã—Ç–∞—è –∫–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ –º–∏—Ä–∞**: Ensure technology/magic consistency throughout
5. **–ó–∞—Ç—è–Ω—É—Ç–∞—è –±–æ–µ–≤–∞—è —Å—Ü–µ–Ω–∞**: Maintain dynamic pacing in action sequences
6. **–ê–±—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–Ω–∞—è –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–æ–≤–∫–∞**: Make endings concrete and specific
7. **–ù–µ—è—Å–Ω–∞—è –º–æ—Ç–∏–≤–∞—Ü–∏—è**: Clarify character and organizational motivations
8. **–°–∫–∞—á–∫–∏ —Ç–µ–º–ø–∞**: Smooth pacing transitions between sections
9. **–ü–µ—Ä–µ–≥—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –≤–Ω—É—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω–∏–º–∏ –º–æ–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∞–º–∏**: Balance thought vs action
10. **–ù–µ–∑–∞–∫—Ä—ã—Ç—ã–µ —Å—é–∂–µ—Ç–Ω—ã–µ –ª–∏–Ω–∏–∏**: Address loose ends within chapter scope

**TARGET LENGTH:** {{target_length}} words

**üìä QUALITY METRICS CHECK (before return):**
‚ñ° Action starts within first 2-3 paragraphs?
‚ñ° Description takes < 20% of text?
‚ñ° Minimum one situation-changing event?
‚ñ° Sensory details are varied (not just visual)?
‚ñ° One dominant sense per scene?
‚ñ° Sentence lengths vary?
‚ñ° Max 2-3 description paragraphs in a row?
‚ñ° All dialogue complete (NO placeholders)?
‚ñ° Repetitive imagery removed?
‚ñ° Technology/magic consistency maintained?

**üö® CONTEXTUAL INTELLIGENCE CHECK:**
‚ñ° Sensory details match scene intensity (high emotion = minimal senses)?
‚ñ° Emotional reactions appropriate to stimulus (no trauma response to minor events)?
‚ñ° Random thoughts only during shock/dissociation?
‚ñ° NO room descriptions during action scenes?
‚ñ° Information reveals have prior foreshadowing?
‚ñ° Breathing room after intense sections?
‚ñ° NO mechanical rule application without context?

**‚ö° QUANTITATIVE TARGETS:**
- Description paragraphs in a row: max 3
- Words before first action: max 150
- Sensory details per paragraph: max 2 (max 1 in high-emotion scenes)
- Emotional intensity matches event severity
- Random thoughts: max 1 per chapter, only during dissociation

Return the fully integrated chapter with minimal changes to specialist content.`
